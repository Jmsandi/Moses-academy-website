### Background & History

**Section Image:** `moses academy/20211021_084714.jpg`

#### The Genesis of Moses Academy

Before the inception of Moses Academy in the Deep Eye Water Community, school-age pupils faced enormous challenges accessing quality education. Children had to walk long distances across the dangerous Waterloo highway to attend school, leading to serious problems including:
- High school dropout rates
- Teenage pregnancy
- Child delinquency
- Limited educational opportunities
- Safety concerns during commute

#### Identifying the Need

The Deep Eye Water community was rapidly growing in population, especially among school-going age children. Despite this growth, it remained one of the most deprived communities within the Waterloo Rural District with:
- Limited Junior Secondary Schools
- Overcrowded primary schools
- Inadequate infrastructure
- Long distances to educational facilities
- Insufficient spaces for the growing student population

#### The Solution: Moses Academy

To salvage this critical situation and reduce the suffering of children, a piece of land was acquired by the proprietor with the specific purpose of providing accessible, quality education. The school was strategically established to ease the challenges children faced in accessing both primary and secondary school education.

#### The Name "MOSES" - A Legacy of Education

The school was named after a great mentor, philanthropist, one-time teacher, pastor, and reverend of the Africa Methodist Episcopal Church. Known for his love of education, passion for children, and humanitarian spirit, he raised up and empowered countless young people through educational support. The founder and proprietor were also beneficiaries of his remarkable legacy.

**The name "MOSES" carries profound meaning:**

**M** - Make  
**O** - Our  
**S** - Society  
**E** - Enviable and  
**S** - Secured

This acronym reflects our commitment to transforming society through education, creating a secure and enviable future for all our students.

#### Official Establishment & Launch
